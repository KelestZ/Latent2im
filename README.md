This is the official code base for our ICLR 2021 paper: Peiye Zhuang, Oluwasanmi Koyejo, Alexander G Schwing, [Enjoy Your Editing: Controllable GANs for Image Editing via Latent Space Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01187). 

In this repository, we propose a latent-space editing framework for semantic image manipulation that fulfills (i) providing continuous manipulation of multiple attributes simultaneously, and (ii) maintaining the original imageâ€™s identity as much as possible while ensuring photo-realism.
